To make prisma work, I need to be able to remote connect to my databases!

This means:
1) The app must route the request to my server
2) NGINX will be set up to send the request out
3) perhaps add prisma or some middleman ... oh, express? Oh... I need to be able to connect a prisma request otherwise it is back to SQL?
4) Possible workflow:
    1) Request made to a root:/subdir
    2) Forward to express server
    3) Redirects with internal permissions, maybe with a header check to maintain security
    4) Request forwarded, response returned

Even better:
1) App sends a trigger request to home
2) NGINX forwards to express
3) Express completes queries... 
4) Can I simply connect my app to a web app that exists in order to let it do it's functions as a proxy?

First task: send a request to the server and get data returned 
1) Express makes the request and returns the response 
2) Therefore, the app just needs to send a secure request that tells express what to do 


After all that:
1) Run prisma in express
2) Have app do a simple fetch to the API
3) ??
4) Profit!

Generic type props

Generic component/child:

export default function ApiCall<T>({
  api,
  key,
  setData,
  setLoading,
}: ApiCallProps<T>)

Specific component/parent:

const [data, setData] = useState<TestData>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);
  ApiCall<TestData>({ api: "GET", key: "testdata", setData, setLoading });
